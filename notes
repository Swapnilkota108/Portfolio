But here comes an interesting question. What if we set our time to 0 instead of 2000ms(2s)? Have a look at this code below.
You would have tthought that the code will execute immediately but it was still console logged at the end. Why is this happening? This is happening because the asynchronous program has been pushed to waiting que and will executed only after the rest of the code executes or if the call stack is empty it will push the asynchronous program to the call stack
