        JavaScript is a programming language. A single threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous language. If you are a beginner, these are quite confusing terms. But don't worry, you will get this.</p>
    <p>Javascript was introduced in the year 1996, by browsers to make web pages more interactive.
        Without browsers Javascript could not exist or to better say no one will bother using it.
        Now you may have a question about the similarity between Java and Javscript? Is there any relation between them. 
        The answer is 'No'. 
        There's abolutely no relation between the two languages. 
        It was just a marketing idea to gimmick developers as Java was very popular around those days.

      Javascript is a beginner friendly and a forgiving language. It does not point out the errors which sometimes makes it difficult to debug or to find problems within the program.
      Javscript has several versions. These versions are known as ECMASCRIPT versions. ECMASCRIPT version 6 came out in the year 2015, which was a major update. Now Javascript has small updates every year. 
      <p>Along with Web programming Javascript is used by some databases such as MongoDB and CouchDB as their scripting language</p>
