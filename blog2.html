Eggs also contain decent amounts of vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, vitamin B6, calcium and zinc. This sums up to 77 calories with 6 grams of protein and 5 grams of healthy fats.
In spite that eggs are one of the most nutritious food there have been a question : Do eggs raise cholesterol?
It is a fact that eggs are high in cholesterol. A a single egg contains 212 mg, which is over half of the recommended daily intake of 300 mg. But what is cholesterol?
<h2>WHAT IS <span>CHOLESTEROL</span> ?</h2>
There are two types of cholesterol: blood cholesterol, which our bodies make and our livers recycle; and dietary cholesterol, found in some of the foods we eat. 
Although high blood cholesterol levels increase heart disease risk, cholesterol in itself is not necessarily bad. In fact, it’s an essential part of our body’s cells, vitamin D, hormones, and bile acids. 
Eggs contain dietary cholesterol and this has led to confusion about their impact on heart health. So should you be worried about cholesterol when eating eggs?
The latest Heart Foundation recommendations put no limit on how many eggs healthy people can eat each week. The Heart Foundation state that eggs have a minimal effect on blood cholesterol levels and eggs are encouraged as part of a heart healthy eating pattern with a reminder to be mindful of what you choose to eat with them. So even if Eggs are high in cholesterol, eating eggs does not adversely affect cholesterol in the blood for the majority of people.</p>
