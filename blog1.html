        Many of us have heard from our friends or some fitness YouTuber or "guru" that nutrition plays the majority role in building muscle. Many of these claims even have the precise percentage of role our nutrition will pay in building our muscle, some says 90%, some says 80% and some other says 50% and so on. But how far these claims are real or true? Building lean muscle mass requires proper training, proper nutrition and rest for proper recovery. So is nutrition the most important factor?</p>Proper nutrition is vital to optimize recovery after endurance exercises but that doesn't mean that just eating and consuming food supplements will help you gain muscles or meet your respective goals. For that to happen you need to train your body to help increase strength and muscle mass. Nutrition,  exercise and rest all are  important for losing fat and gaining strength.
        
        Nutrition will have a great impact on your body composition and physique goals than any other fitness parameter. When you train your body the muscle fibres  tears down and growth of new muscles happens during our rest to repair the damage thus making it stronger and bigger. During rest our body releases the highest amount of growth hormones which helps in muscle recovery thus gaining new muscles. The combination of healthy nutrition, training and proper rest is implemented is when successful body change happens.
        
        So, the conclusion is that all three play equal roles in fitness and nutrition, training and rest all plays 100% of the role in your fitness goals. Therefore, the percentages are 100% nutrition, 100% training and 100% rest.</p>
